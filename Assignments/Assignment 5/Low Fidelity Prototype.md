### Personas
The target user for this project in general are people who are undergoing hardships of any scale who may feel desperate for help, but overwhelmed by the obstacles one must overcome when looking thorugh unorganized websited packed with information. Target-user demographics are as follows:

|Category|Details|

|**Gender**|Male, female, or other|
|**Age**|18-24, 45+|
|**Occupation**|Student, teacher, or<br>primary care guardian|

The aforementioned criteria was determined after reviewing statistics on suicide rates in Oregon to determine which subgroups are most vulnerable to this cause of death.

## Wireflow Test Notes

#### Task #1: Access Crisis Services
User was able to access crisis services very easily, but was unsure of what "crisis services" meant. The user did not understand that pressing the call button would redirect them to a phone call with someone who can help them talk through any urgent matters, including suicide attempts. The accessibility of the feature is a lot better, but I need to make sure the user has more information regarding the redirection of the link. I could add a one sentence caption such as "If you are in urgent need of help and wish to speak to someone click here."
#### Task #2: Access Counseling Services
The user was able to follow the expected flow to access counseling services and did not seem to have trouble. User also commented that it made little sense that after reaching the deatiled counseling services page, a click on the "back" arrow would send them back to the oirginal homepage instead of the previous page they were on. I agree, that is confusing and the user would have a more efficient experience if 
#### Feature: ChatBot
User was able to access the ChatBot and understood the basic function. No issues regarding accessibility and basic understanding. However, user belived the only way to use teh ChatBot was by clicking on the "Quick search" buttons and did not consicer typing in the textbox at the bottom. Perhaps an increase in color contrast will allow the text box to be more noticable. The text box message can also be modified to say "Ask me anything" or something similar so users are aware they can treat the ChatBot like a searchbar but with direct interaction from someone on the other end if they need it. 

All tasks were successfully completed.

## Summary
workin gon this low-fidelity protype was unlike anything else I had experienced. In order to create the protype I had to put myself in the user's shows and predict how they woul dinteract with the site based on previous observations I've made. I noticed the user tended to speed through the site in search of information, almost frantically, perhaps caused by nervousness of being a participant. However, I used this to mimic the state of someone who is frantically searching for help because they needed it promptly. For the most part, previous tests helped me complete this project, but I learned more observing the use interact with this prototype. I think I did a pretty good job witht he draft, but I think I could have encouraged the user to think out loud more to have even more data as I move forward.
