# Digital Humanities Interface Design: Oregon Health Authority Website

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to make the Oregon Health Authority website, specfically the mental heath services page, mobil-friendly for users who may be in need of therpay or other mental healht services. With suicide in its top 10 leading causes of death (reference), the Oregon mental health page. should not only have releveant information readily accessible but it should serve to allleviate rather than cause stress for its intended audience. This new interface was design to make key pieces of information and contacts accessible without the user having to five through various quick links to get to relevant information. The color scheme is meant to draw the users attention to key compononets like Crisis, Counseling and other related services.
