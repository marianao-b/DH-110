# Digital Humanities Interface Design: Oregon Health Authority Website

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to make the Oregon Health Authority website, specfically the mental heath services page, mobil-friendly for users who may be in need of therpay or other mental healht services. With suicide in its top 10 leading causes of death (reference), the Oregon mental health page. should not only have releveant information readily accessible but it should serve to allleviate rather than cause stress for its intended audience. This new interface was design to make key pieces of information and contacts accessible without the user having to five through various quick links to get to relevant information. The color scheme is meant to draw the users attention to key compononets like Crisis, Counseling and other related services.

> The prototype is designed for an iPhone 13 pro but this similar layout will exists for other smartphone devices. 
The image below illustartes the new interface design using a wireflow I designed with a color palette I chose using Adobe. The prototype is linked [here](https://www.figma.com/file/7Z1M1BWsyReR32XkZcOrk5/Interface-Design?node-id=15%3A64) as well as in the titile of this section.

I decided to use the font "Roboto" size 16 for the body text because it was the easiest to read and the most neutral font I liked. Given that I wanted to differentiate beteen body and heaidng with both size anf font style, I figured a more netral font would be easier for the user to read. I wanted to use "Quicksand" for all of the title fonts (Heaidng, and subhead) because I feel the think and minimalist font creates a clean aestehtic and makes the page look less overwhelmeing; it no longer look spacked with information, even though a lot of the same content is present. Although the design does not make use of captions and other deatisl often, i decided to add a tyepface for this--I used "Roboto" size 10. I found it approrpate to use the same font as the body text so as to keep some cohesiveness with the design while giving myself the opportunity to include desriptors for ambiguous sections names such as "crisis services"
