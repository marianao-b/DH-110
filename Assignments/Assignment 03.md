# About
----------------
The Oregon Health Authority (OHA) website places little to no emphasis on how to attain mental health services. With suicide in the top 10 causes of death in this state ([reference](https://visual-data.dhsoha.state.or.us/t/OHA/views/Oregonannualtrendsinmortality/TrendsDash?:showAppBanner=false&:display_count=n&:showVizHome=n&:origin=viz_share_link&:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&:embed=y)), this is alarming. Although mental health services cannot singlehandedly solve the problem, I believe their accessibility is crucial. 

The goal is to make crisis hotlines, counseling services and counseling information readily available so that people who are in need of help are not met with frustration the moment they decide they are ready to reach out. The site’s biggest issue is organization; the OHA is a very general site which encmopasses anything related to health in the state of Oregon. Because of this, the site currently functions as an information dump, so most of my project will consist of reorganizing information already on the website, but to emphasize mental health services.

# Research Goal and Requirements
----------------
The goal of my project would be to support users accessing crisis hotline/management information as well as counseling services. The ladder encompasses dealing and living with trauma, depression, anxiety, drug abuse, etc. This also means making the website mobile friendly in an effort to make it even more accessible. 

## Maslows Pyramid of Needs
The aforementioned activity directly meets the following needs

|Need|Description|
|-|-|
|**Safety**|Being able to access mental health services may serve as an aid for individuals still learning to cope with emotional baggage. Not only will it provide some emotional security, but improvement in emotional health can and oftentimes does translate into improvement in physical health (citation)|
|**Love and Social Belonging**|Having access to a variety of mental health services, or merely being able to navigate getting help may contribute to a user's sense of social belonging. Perhaps getting the help they need (or may not know they need) will strengthen familial, and friendly relationships and facilitate both platonic and romantic intimacy. When users who suffer from any mental illness do such a thing, they may create a support system for themselves which allows them to navigate the complexities of their mental health without resorting to suicice| 
|**Esteem**|Further, I believe my proposed activity will tap into high-esteem for users. They may feel a greater responsibility to take care of themselves if the information is easily accessible and readily available. Perhaps receiving the care they need, or knowing they took a step in doing so, can help foster independence, confidence and strength|

## Limitations
Some limitations regarding the current solutions follow that it takes too much time for someone to access information they need. Social media apps and websites are perfect examples of how to throw information in someone’s face without directly overwhelming them, how to make information readily available and usually only one literal click away (example: I can view my Instagram messages by clicking on the paper airplane icon that signifies a message). Although the OHA website is not a social media platform, I think basics, like design (structure) and style (iconography and color) can be be innovative ways to make the website more accessible to our target user*.

Some limitations of my plan follow that not 100% of the population who needs this kind of care has access to the internet or a mobile device. However, a little over 90% of the state’s population has access to the internet meaning that pursuing this project coil potentially affect a great number of users statewide ([reference](https://broadbandnow.com/Oregon)).

###### **Specifics of our target will be detailed in the following section*

# Target User
-----------
The target users for this project are people over the age of 15. Most suicide deaths in 2019 occured amongst inidividuals between the ages of 15 and 45 ([reference](https://visual-data.dhsoha.state.or.us/t/OHA/views/Oregonannualtrendsinmortality/TrendsDash?:showAppBanner=false&:display_count=n&:showVizHome=n&:origin=viz_share_link&:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&:embed=y)). Although most suicide deaths are male, I have chosen to maintain my target user’s gender unconstrained given that people who may benefit from behaviorl health services may be reffered by friends and family of various genders. The target users may be people who need behavioral health services, parents of children who are in need, and adults who are seeking services for their parents. 

##Context
 Users may complete the activity if they are the ones who are seeking help for themselves, their family, or a loved one. 

# Methods
----------
For this project I will collect qualitative research. I may record quantitative notes to denote how long or how many attempts it takes to complete an activity, but the bulk of the research will follow the participant’s reactions and commentary. My research will follow an overt observation of the participant attempting to complete three activities detailed in the next section. I will be a passive observer and will not interact with the participant unless it is to direct them from activity to activity, or to help with technical difficulties (internet problems, site crash, etc.)
