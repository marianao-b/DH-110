# Pilot Usability Testing (UT) -- Mariana Orozco-Berber DH 110

## Introduction

I did my original heuristic evaluation on the OregonEligibility site, but I am choosing to continue with my project by working with the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) website. The purpose of this usability testing is still very similar. I want to make sure that emergency mental health services and information on mental health services in general are easily accessible to those in need. According to the OHA, suicide is amongst the top 10 causes of death in Oregon, and I believe the state should make it easier for people to find and access information regarding mental health services for themlsves or a loved one. People should not be faced with frustration when seeking help.

## Methodology

After conducting a heuristic evaluation, I found the top three issues that were challenging and/or inefficient:<br><br> 
**1.** Aesthetic and minimalist design<br>
**2.** Flexibility and efficiency use, and<br>
**3.** Recognition over recall.

Given the issues above, I decided to conduct a usability test that will allow me to see if these problems are actually concerning to and/or for the user. The participant will be asked to perform the following tasks with respect to the heuristic issue I am trying to observe and possibly fix.

|Heuristic value|Issue|Task|
|--|--|--|
|Aesthetic and Minimalist Design|The deisgn makes it difficult to access crisis prevention resources|The participant will be asked to locate crisis line information to see if the design emphasizes this information the way it should.|
|Flexibility and efficiency use|The design may be overwhelming to noivce users, but a hassle for experts who may benefit from quick links for easier and more efficient access to information|The participant will be asked to find information regarding the Oregon Health Plan and its benefits to see if they find it via a shortcut given that it is listed in multiple areas of the site.|
|Recognition over recall|The design consists of a lot of differnt collapsable menu bars with many subheadings which may complicate the user's experience|The participant will be asked to find contact information regarding counseling services to see if necessary menu tabs needed to navigate the site and access urgent information are easily accessible throughout their experience.|

This UT will be conducetd via Zoom in a private and quiet location. The participant will be asked to use their mobile device given that one of my goals is to make this information easily accessible, which may be made possible by observing and enhancing the site's mobile experience. I will provide information regarding the session for the participant. I will then walk them through the consent process and background information questions. I will then ask the participant to complete threee tasks while I dictate them step by step. Given that the UT will be conducted via mobile device, it is difficult for the participant to maintain multiple tabs open on the same screen and dictating the tasks will foster a more organic user experience of the OHA site. The participant will complete post-test questions and the demographics information with the latter being completed off-camera.

## Reflection

Overall I feel the UT went well. I think the participant was very attentive and active in asking questions. I also feel I provided enough information and instruction for him to do each task the way it was intended for the test. I did, however, notice that I slurred my words quite a bit and my voice was very monotone which may have made any other participant uncomfortable or intimidated. I also had some trouble with interrupting the user as he spoke, and although this had to do with connectivity issues, it may have come off as rude and I need to work on being more patient if conducting a UT online this way.<br>

I think the biggest thing I should work on is patience. I found it challenging to hold back as I saw the user overlook the information they were asked to find, and I caught myself intervening towards the end but this is something that could have tampered with the outcome of my study.<br>

This test allowed me to test the waters, and in the future I would like to create more rapport with participants to ease the tension in the (virtual) room and allow them to feel more free to ask questions. Although this participant seemed to be comfortable with me I believe I can and should do a better job because not all of my participants will be as extroverted.
